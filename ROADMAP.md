# Roadmap

## Short term
* Provide more flexible matching (eg the keys should match, and the classes of the values should match, but the values of each key do not need to be equal). This is to make the pact verification less brittle. This is a WIP. See details [here](https://github.com/bethesque/pact-specification/tree/version-2)

## Long term

* Add XML support
* Create a test matrix to ensure compatibility with implementations in other languages
